#### At what point, if any, can new-media art become sentient?
><small>*Sentience is the capacity to feel, perceive, or experience subjectively. Eighteenth-century philosophers used the concept to distinguish the ability to think (reason) from the ability to feel (sentience)*

#### In works which involve a program learning (or at least independently acquiescing stuff), synthesising and expressing knowledge what do we define as the point, or process, of 'art'
- <small>Can we express not-art projects like AlphaGo as art? If so what's the artwork - is it the performance of the game, the physical program, the trace of the program or the whole process etc</small>
- <small>Can we have sub-arts with in a greater artwork or projects i.e. Can I have an artwork which is at once a website, an object, an installation, a performance etc - how does one sell this?</small>
- <small>Who is the author here? The programmers of AlphaGo, the program, the guy who plays it or all three</small>



#### Is new-media art reaching a point of incommensurability in relation to 'regular' modes of art making?
><small>*Commensurability is a concept whereby theories are commensurable if scientists can discuss using a shared nomenclature that allows direct comparison of theories to determine which theory is more valid or useful. On the other hand, theories are incommensurable if they are embedded in starkly contrasting conceptual frameworks whose languages do not overlap sufficiently to permit scientists to directly compare the theories or to cite empirical evidence favoring one theory over the other.*
[-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensurability_(philosophy_of_science))</small>

- <small>Following from the previous question - If we construct new-media 'art' with more distinct nomenclature, perhaps we estrange 'old' and 'new' art </small>
- <small>Is this a institutional problem i.e Where do you put web art or Internet of Things Art?</small>
- <small>More indirectly when we transgress a point where the data or program, or process, is not so obvious does that make it more or less like painting?</small>
